# Request a blacklist for a user

> **Note:** Users can be only blacklisted by Dangerous Discord staff.
{.is-info}


If you have found a user that needs to be blacklisted for a reason or two. You can contact us by joining our Discord server: https://discord.gg/NshzB4jt8K

We also highly recommend to report the user to Discord by [submitting a request](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) on their support site


## What kind of users we do not blacklist
- Spam bots (too common)
- BOT Accounts (the bot may have been hijacked)
