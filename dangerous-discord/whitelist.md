If you are getting reported by users that want to troll, and is possibly giving misinformation (giving bad reputation to you), feel free to contact us, by joining our Discord server: https://discord.gg/NshzB4jt8K

If you have any screenshots of proof that people are "troll reporting", please include the screenshots in your message. 

Dangerous Discord does not tolerate bullying, and we will always remove all fake reports.

## Bot Whitelist
At this time, we won't whitelist any unknown bots. We are looking to make changes on this! Feel free to contact us though, and we will make a decision.

## What kind of users we do not whitelist
- Users that are already blacklisted
