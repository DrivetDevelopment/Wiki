# Request a blacklist for a user

> **Note:** Users can be only blacklisted by Dangerous Discord staff.
{.is-info}

If you have found a user that needs to be blacklisted for a reason or two. You can contact us by joining our Discord server: https://discord.gg/NshzB4jt8K. We will need to get some proof in order to blacklist the user, so be ready to provide any image proof.

You can also contact us by email: [aleksi@drivet.xyz](mailto:aleksi@drivet.xyz)

We also highly recommend to report the user to Discord by [submitting a request](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) on their support site


## What kind of users we do not blacklist
- DM advertisers (not dangerous, just report the user as spammer)
- BOT Accounts (the bot may have been hijacked, different case if the bot is made for verification scams)
