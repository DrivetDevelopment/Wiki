# Request a blacklist for a user

> **Note:** Users can be only blacklisted by Dangerous Discord staff.
{.is-info}

If you have found a user that needs to be blacklisted for a reason or two. You can contact us by joining our Discord server: https://discord.gg/NshzB4jt8K. We will need to get some proof in order to blacklist the user, so be ready to provide any image proof.



We also highly recommend to report the user to Discord by [submitting a request](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) on their support site


## What kind of users we do not blacklist
- Full list of raid-bots. (If your server has been raided and the usernames has same characters on every bot, give us some usernames and we will add them to our raid-bot list)
- DM advertisers (not dangerous, just report the user as spammer)
- BOT Accounts (the bot may have been hijacked, different case if the bot is made for verification scams)
