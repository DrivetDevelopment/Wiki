# ~~Frequently~~ Least Asked Questions
Some questions that i managed to get out of my head

## How do you pay for servers?
We run on a low budget. We try to spend minimal amount of money to servers. All money goes out of my pocket. Currenty we pay nothing to provide these all great services to everyone, except that we pay our domain yearly for about 10â‚¬

## How much bandwidth does your servers use?
You can view our website/server thats on our HetrixTools monitoring page: https://monitor.drivet.xyz

## Does Drivet support crypto?
No, and we never will support crypto. All that stuff is bad for the environment. Google it yourself!
